# Tools Used:
Python

# Aim:
The aim in this series is to solve the Advent of Code challenges using Python (at least, for this year's problems) and keep up with the day-by-day schedule of release along with some friends. Secondary aims included experimenting with Python syntax, trying to fit one-liners wherever possible, and generally sacrificing readability for the sake of bragging in a groupchat.

Update 12/16/22: I got as far as day 15, where I only finished solving pt. 2 at 2am. Will continue to solve the rest at a slower pace.

# Additional Notes:
The code is not always super clean given the secondary aims.
